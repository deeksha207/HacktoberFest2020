//Java supports a special block, called static block (also called static clause) which can be used for static initializations of a class. This code inside static block is executed only once: the first time the class is loaded into memory.

import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
static int B,H;
static boolean flag;
//static block will execute once when class is loaded into the memory 
static{

    flag=false;Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
    B=sc.nextInt();
    H=sc.nextInt();
if(B>0 && H>0)
flag=true;
else{
System.out.println("java.lang.Exception: Breadth and height must be positive");
}
}

public static void main(String[] args){
		if(flag){
			int area=B*H;
			System.out.print(area);
		}
		
	}//end of main

}//end of class
